// This class is used to track native ads -- ads that are rendered using native UI elements rather than a WebView.
// The class creates an internally managed WebView instance, loads our JavaScript tag into it, and then dispatches
// viewability-related signals (pertaining to the native ad it is tracking) into that WebView.

#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import "BELLMoatBootstrap.h"

@interface BELLMoatTracker : BELLMoatObject

// Use this to track ads that can't run JavaScript. This method accepts any UIView. Web-based ads, including "opaque"
// web containers (Google's DFPBannerView, etc.) are best tracked using MoatBootstrap's injectDelegateWrapper instead.

// Use this to track hybrid, two-view ads that consist both of a native UIView and a web-based component.
